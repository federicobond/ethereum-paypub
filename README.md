ethereum-paypub (UNTESTED)
==========================

An ethereum implementation of the PayPub protocol for trustless payments for
information publishing.

Two contracts are included:

 * `PayPub` is a very simple preimage disclosure contract
 * `PayPub2` includes the commitment to release N chunks by a certain block height

I didn't have time to test these contracts, I just wanted to get the idea out
there and commit myself to keep improving them.
